# haulage

A haulage company manages its information using a relational database. The database provided (not in this repo) contains information from a typical six-month
period of operation.

I have answered 5 questions for my coursework, which were single SQL statements, compatible with MySQL. 

I have also created more SQL statements to accomodate new facilities. These included inserting sample data.

As I have used mariaDB for the coursework, only SQL statements are available in this repository.
